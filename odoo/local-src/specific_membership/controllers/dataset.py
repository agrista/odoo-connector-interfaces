# This is a workaround to allow to use odoo js api for anonymous users.
# Since the original method `/web/dataset/call_kw` has `auth=user`
# we cannot use it because we have no session.
# Model's access rights seems well handled by ACLs
# but to stay secure I'm just enabling this only for some models.
# An OCA module is going to avoid this problem,
# will come from this PR https://github.com/OCA/web/pull/402
